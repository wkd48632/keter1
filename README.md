# Keter
No based language

## Why no based?
From now on, languages are leashed by implementation. x86, x64, arm, and so on.

Is C really X-platform language? Are they really X-platform languages based on C? So I started this insane project.

## How to use?
```
wrap main.keter main.c
```

## How to bootstrap?
IDK.
It'll maybe c-like c++.
I'm poor at OOP, but who cares?
